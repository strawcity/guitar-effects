# Basic heirarchy

- /documentation/README.md is the source of truth. No changes can be made to
  this file unless given permission
- Code should be written to match what is in /documentation/README.md
- The code should always reflect what is in the /documentation folder
- All new code should preserve all functionality described in the /documentation
  folder
